# Pantheon Must Use Plugin for WordPress

This repo syncs [Pantheon's WordPress Must Use Plugin][2] from the Official [Pantheon WordPress Upstream][1].

## Why?

Simple answer is I needed to use this must use plugin on a project that was not using Pantheon's WordPress Upstream (or any upstream, for that matter);

## Installation

If wanting to use this as a plugin on Pantheon, it must __NOT__ be installed as a Git Submodule (as [Pantheon does not support submodules][3]).
